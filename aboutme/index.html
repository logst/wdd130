 <h1>about me</h1>  
 <h2>David Logan Sutherland</h2>
 <p>Hello all my name is Logan Sutherland we're just gearing up for the fall in winter here in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. I was born into a member family, I'm the youngest of three with two older sisters who now have children of their own two nieces with my oldest sister, and four nephews with my second youngest sister Who lives close to us so since I still live at home me and my parents take care of them a lot which I guess you could say our force of habit is my favorite pastime they are just bundles of fun. I've been chasing after the graphic design certificate for quite some time and I'm almost there and given website design is probably going to be something I'm going to be doing and even though this class isn't in the course I figure it's going to be relevant and I need the credits to get the certificate. </p>
